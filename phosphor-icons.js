// Phosphor Icons, "fill" weight (MIT License — see PHOSPHOR-ICONS-LICENSE.txt).
// Same pack already license-cleared for Mom Affirmation Cards / New Mom
// Survival Deck — reused here per the icon-sourcing decision locked
// 2026-08-12, remapped to this product's own 4 prompt categories. Paths
// fetched verbatim from phosphor-icons/core (raw/fill/*.svg) so the
// coordinates are exact, not reconstructed from memory.
//
// One icon per cue-routine-reward category only — the framework, tracker,
// reflection, and motivation cards use a typographic layout instead (see
// app.js), so they don't need their own icon.
//
// #2d6e7e is this product's own placeholder fill, swapped for the buyer's
// chosen accent at PDF-build time (see preloadIcons in app.js) — same
// find-and-replace pattern every other GoodStockPress deck uses.
